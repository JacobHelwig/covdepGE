\title{covdepGE: Covariate Dependent Graph Estimation}
\description{
A weighted psuedo-likelihood approach for modeling the conditional dependence structure of data as a function of an extraneous covariate. Inference is conducted via a block mean-field variational approximation.
}
\details{
The core function, \code{covdepGE}, uses the weighted psuedo-likelihood
approach to estimate the conditional dependence structure of the data as a
function of an extraneous covariate. Inference is conducted efficiently via
a parallelized block mean-field variational approximation. Three choices
for hyperparameter specification are offered, the default being a hybrid
between model averaging and grid search.

Additionally, the function \code{generateData} returns covariate dependent data
based on the data from the simulation study in (1). The functions
\code{inclusionCurve}, \code{matViz}, and \code{plot.covdepGE} enable visualization of the
estimates returned by the \code{covdepGE} function.
